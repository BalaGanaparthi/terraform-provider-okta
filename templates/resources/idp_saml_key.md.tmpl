Identity Provider Signing Key can not be updated, it can only be created or removed. Thus, in situation
where Identity Provider Signing Key should be updated, one can not simply change `x5c` and apply the changes.
This will cause the error, because the key can not be removed if it's used by the provider. To avoid this situation,
the behavior of the resource update process is as follows:

- create a new identity provider key
- list all identity providers that are using the old key (**even the ones that are managed outside terraform!**)
- assign a new key to these identity providers
- remove old identity provider key

For more details, please refer to the [original issue](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/issues/672).
